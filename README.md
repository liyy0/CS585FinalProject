# CS585 Final Project - Segmentation of Living Cells in Microscope Images

> **Team Members**: Yuyan Li, Fanjie Gao, Jiayin Fan<br>

## Project Overview
The BU Biomedical Image Library (BU-BIL) has collected hundreds of cell images using time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy. This resource includes "ground-truth" segmentations that provide a basis for comparing the effectiveness of proposed segmentation methods. The large volume of data presents a significant challenge for manual interpretation, which is not only labor-intensive and costly but also susceptible to human error. To address this, we propose the development of automated segmentation approaches, including model training and refining connected components.

## Dataset
A library of cell images publicly available: [BU Biomedical Image Library (BU-BIL)](https://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/betke/BiomedicalImageSegmentation/index.html).
